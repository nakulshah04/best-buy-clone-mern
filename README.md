# 🛒 Best Buy Clone

This project is a simplistic clone of the Best Buy website, built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js).

## 📦 Dependencies

- 🗝️ **dotenv**: Stores sensitive information like API keys and database URLs in a `.env` file and loads them into the runtime environment.
- 🚀 **Express**: Provides a minimal web framework for building the backend API, handling HTTP requests, managing middleware, and defining routes.
- 🐍 **Mongoose**: Simplifies interaction with MongoDB, enabling schema definitions, validation, and easy CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## 📝 Why `npm init -y` in the root?

Running `npm init -y` initializes a `package.json` file in the root directory of the project. This file:

- Manages project configurations, scripts, and metadata.
- Tracks dependencies and development tools.
- Enables scripts like `npm run dev` to start both frontend and backend servers concurrently for easier development.

This setup also aids in deployment by ensuring consistent package versions and configurations.
